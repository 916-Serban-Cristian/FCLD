Final lab scanner (integrate Lab 1a & 1b, Lab 2, Lab 3)

The scanner receives a String (the program) and a list of Strings (the tokens from token.in).
The method scan performs the scanning process to create the pif and st.
At each step comments and whitespaces are skipped and then each token is matched into the right category and is added to its corresponding table in the st symbol table.
Regex is used to match each token to a corresponding type.
In the pif the string constants correspond to the value -2, int constants -1, tokens from token.in 0 and identifiers the position in the identifier table.
The scanner raises a ScannerException if an error is found.
The st is written in the file ST.out and the pif in the file PIF.out.
